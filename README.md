# SelfDrivingCarProjects
Project files and directories for self-driving car

This repository is for Udacity self driving class. The projects in this course uses the google tensorflow library. I have created a python 3.6.1 virtualenv and have installed jupyter and tensorflow there. 

My installation steps are as follows:

update pip, conda and conda-env to latest version
```python
conda install -c anaconda pip
```
conda install -c anaconda pip

create and activate a python virtual environment named tensorflow
```python
C://Users//self_driving_car_projects>conda create -n tensorflow python=3.6.1
C://Users//self_driving_car_projects>activate tensorflow
```

install tensorflow
```python
(tensorflow) C://Users//self_driving_car_projects>conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
```
or
```python
(tensorflow) C://Users//self_driving_car_projects>pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow
```


install the Jupyter Notebook:

```python
(tensorflow) C://Users//self_driving_car_projects>pip install jupyter
```

Starting an jupyter notebook inside a python virtualenv
```python
(tensorflow) C://Users//self_driving_car_projects>jupyter notebook
```
